I'm thinking of a more streamlined approach to buying groceries for the purpose of creating a specific dish (recipes). I want to have the navbar and the main content be "floating" above the background. The background will consist of vertical columns of colors that dynamically move based on the "phase" of the navbar. I want to have 3-4 sections.
    1. recipe lookup
        -this is where you can look up recipes, its ingredients, and add them to a list.
    2. list of recipes selected. 
        - this is where the user can add more of or delete a recipe.
    3. the checklist of ingredients required.
        -the user can add or delete ingredients based on preference. The deleting of ingredients most likely will be because the user already has some in stock?
    4. the final checklist of ingredients 
        -the user can mark an ingredient to signify that they procured that ingredient.
